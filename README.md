# Big Brain Thinking Service

A powerful TypeScript-based service that revolutionizes problem-solving through advanced cognitive modeling and dynamic adaptation. This system implements three sophisticated thinking paradigms: Sequential Thinking for structured analysis, Chain of Draft (CoD) for iterative refinement, and Integrated Thinking for unified cognitive processing. Each model is built on solid theoretical foundations and practical applications in artificial reasoning.

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundations

### Sequential Thinking Model

Sequential Thinking is based on the cognitive science principle of structured, hierarchical problem decomposition. It implements:

- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Manages complexity through systematic thought segmentation
- **Metacognitive Processing**: Self-monitoring and adaptation of thinking strategies
- **Parallel Distributed Processing**: Enables simultaneous thought path exploration
- **Dynamic Systems Theory**: Adapts processing based on real-time feedback
- **Information Processing Theory**: Optimizes thought flow and cognitive resource allocation

### Chain of Draft (CoD) Model

CoD implements iterative refinement based on established writing and thinking methodologies:

- **Recursive Refinement Theory**: Systematic improvement through structured iteration
- **Quality-Driven Development**: Confidence-based progression through drafts
- **Cognitive Apprenticeship**: Learning from previous drafts and revisions
- **Metacognitive Regulation**: Self-monitoring of draft quality and progress
- **Distributed Cognition**: Leveraging collective knowledge across drafts

### Integrated Thinking Model

Combines multiple cognitive paradigms for enhanced problem-solving:

- **Cognitive Integration Theory**: Unified processing of multiple thought streams
- **Resource Allocation Theory**: Optimal distribution of cognitive resources
- **Adaptive Processing Framework**: Dynamic adjustment of thinking strategies
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Integration of different cognitive approaches
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Enhanced capabilities through model interaction

   - Use parallel processing for independent thoughts/drafts
   - Monitor adaptation history

3. **Confidence Thresholds**

   - Adjusts automatically based on success rate
   - Can be configured manually

## 🐛 Error Handling

```typescript
// Sequential Thinking
try {
    const result = sequentialService.processThought(thought);
} catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes('confidence')) {
        // Handle confidence threshold errors
    } else if (error.message.includes('maxDepth')) {
        // Handle depth limit errors
    }
}

// Chain of Draft
try {
    const result = await draftService.processDraft(draft);
} catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes('validation')) {
        // Handle draft validation errors
    } else if (error.message.includes('revision')) {
        // Handle revision-related errors
    }
}
